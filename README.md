# web-app-in-a-box

This Chrome Extension will let you run any web app or web site in a Chrome pop-out box. Just enter a URL, and you're done!

This is based on a Chrome extension I made (https://goo.gl/Ip3Vwi) for the <a href="http://taskrocket.info/">Task Rocket</a> project management system.

This modified version removes all the Task Rocket branding essentially making it a white-label product for anyone to integrate into their own services or products.

<h2>How to test in Chrome</h2>

1. Go to Chrome settings -> More Tools -> Extensions
2. Enable the <strong>Developer Mode</strong> checkbox.
3. Hit the <strong>Load Unpacked Extension</strong> button.
4. Browse to where you have this repo stored on your local machine.

If you want to publish your own version on the official Chrome Web Store, see the <a href="https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish">official docs</a>.
